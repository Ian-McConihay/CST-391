## Instructor Feedback from Milestone 3

> "Ian, all you have to do is post only the link to the markdown file, nothing else.  Think about what I am saying.  All the other links should be on that one markdown page.  I post on all my sites a category ## Links and have my links below.

 

Please remember that you want to capture everything under ONE UMBRELLA, I Hope this make sense, let me know in Halo with your comments :-)

 

Now to your work, excellent work and very impressive you have learned both MermaidJS and Marp.  Keep doing FANTASTIC :-)"

## Response to Feedback

> I consolidated all project materials under one markdown file, including a clear ## Links section, as suggested. Diagram explanations were also refined for clarity and professionalism.

## REST API Documentation

The API used by the Angular application supports the following endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint              | Description                        |
|--------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/api/devotions`      | Retrieve all devotionals           |
| GET    | `/api/devotions/:id`  | Retrieve a single devotional       |
| POST   | `/api/devotions`      | Create a new devotional            |
| PUT    | `/api/devotions/:id`  | Update an existing devotional      |
| DELETE | `/api/devotions/:id`  | Delete a devotional                |

The Angular service uses `HttpClient` to call these endpoints via relative URLs mapped to `http://localhost:3000/api/devotions`.

## Lessons Learned

- Implementing full CRUD in Angular is straightforward when services and routing are well organized
- Bootstrap makes layout easier but still requires tuning for mobile devices
- Using Angular's standalone components greatly simplified modular design
- Keeping backend field names (`title`, `content`, `date`) in sync with frontend bindings is essential to avoid 400/500 errors
- Clear separation of concerns (routes, services, components) enables better testing and debugging

## Final Thoughts

Milestone 4 successfully bridges the REST API developed in Milestone 3 with a fully functional Angular UI. The project now allows users to journal daily devotions through an intuitive web interface backed by a scalable database and modular code structure. Milestone 5 will introduce additional enhancements like authentication, filters, and possibly dashboard visualizations.
