## Overview

Milestone 6 represents the culmination of the full-stack **Daily Devotional Tracker** project, bringing together a RESTful API backend, two complete frontend implementations (Angular and React), and a polished user experience. This final milestone focuses on demonstrating both technical proficiency and thoughtful design by:

- Combining REST API logic with multiple frontends
- Supporting full CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Replacing modal-based UI with routing-based page navigation
- Adding visual and user interaction enhancements via Bootstrap and SweetAlert2
- Providing accessibility insights through a Christian worldview

Each component was developed to simulate real-world development conditions with version control, modular architecture, and end-user usability in mind.

---

## Milestone Highlights

- **Backend:** Express.js + TypeScript with MySQL integration
- **Frontend 1:** Angular single-page application with Bootstrap styling
- **Frontend 2:** React functional components with React Router and SweetAlert2
- **API Testing:** All endpoints verified using Postman
- **Database:** MySQL schema and test data created manually
- **Presentation:** Project walkthrough with code and feature explanations

---

## Lessons Learned

-  **Routing-based forms** are cleaner and easier to manage than dynamic modals.
-  **Styling** significantly enhances user feedback with minimal code.
-  **Component separation** in React and Angular makes debugging and development more efficient.
-  **.env and config isolation** are critical for real-world deployment preparation.
-  **RESTful practices** streamline frontend/backend communication and scalability.
-  **Christian worldview insights** remind us that accessibility is not only technical but moral: good UX is a reflection of serving others well.
