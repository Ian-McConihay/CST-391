## Introduction

Milestone 5 represents the final stage of the Daily Devotional Tracker React application, focused on refining the user interface, enhancing usability, and completing the full suite of CRUD functionality. Building upon previous milestones, this version replaces modal forms with dedicated routing for creation and editing, improving both accessibility and reliability. The application now features a responsive design using Bootstrap, integrated delete confirmations with SweetAlert2, and a clean, card-based layout that encourages daily journaling. These enhancements contribute to a more polished, user-friendly experience while maintaining a clear separation of concerns in the codebase.

## Lessons Learned

- **Routing over modals**: Using dedicated pages instead of modals reduced bugs and improved UX.
- **Component reuse**: Reusing a single form component for both create and edit kept the logic DRY.
- **UI polish matters**: Even small changes like shadows and focus styling significantly improved aesthetics.
- **Client-side search**: Implementing simple filtering made content much easier to browse.
- **Confirmation dialogs**: Using SweetAlert made destructive actions feel safer and more professional.

## Final Thoughts

Milestone 5 completes the core CRUD functionality in a fully navigable React application. By enhancing the interface, polishing the user experience, and integrating feedback from previous milestones, this project now offers a professional and usable devotional tracker. Future enhancements may include authentication, date filtering, and backend persistence with MongoDB or PostgreSQL.
