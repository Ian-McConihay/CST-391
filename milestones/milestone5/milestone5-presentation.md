## Introduction

Milestone 5 completes the Daily Devotional Tracker by delivering a fully functional React-based frontend integrated with a RESTful Express API. This version improves UX by replacing modals with dedicated pages, enhancing styling with custom CSS and Bootstrap, and adding SweetAlert2 confirmations for deletion. Each feature supports daily journaling in a responsive, modern web interface, showcasing full CRUD operations with clean code organization.

## Project Overview

- Full-stack web application
- REST API (Express.js + TypeScript)

## MySQL Table Setup

```sql
CREATE TABLE devotions (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,

);
```

## Challenges Overcome
